Add the commands here as .py files. Copy and paste the blueprint and fill with your command logic.
The command is automatically imported and registered in the system start.
All the commands must be in the 'commands' folder, and not in subfolders.
# e.g. command file: my_command.py
    name = 'my_command' # the name of the command is the file name without the .py extension
    handler = handler() # the handler function to execute when the command is called
